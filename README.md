# SPF: Social Proximity Framework #

## What is SPF ##
Social Proximity Framework (SPF) enables social interactions in social smart spaces. It provides an additional software layer on top of a networking middleware to offer different functions enabling social interaction in proximity. External applications may leverage SPF to advertise a social profile in proximity or to discover other profiles matching different queries associated to social interests. Moreover, SPF offers a software library that can be used to access the framework and implement applicative services, without dealing with the complexities of networking programming. SPF is currently conceived and implemented for Android devices. 

SPF is a project developed at 
Dipartimento di Elettronica Informazione e Bioingegneria
Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy
